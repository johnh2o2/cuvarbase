# GPU Architecture Analysis for BLS Performance

## Question 1: Have we leveraged batching?

**Answer: Not yet.** Current implementation processes lightcurves sequentially:

```python
for t, y, dy in lightcurves:
    power = bls.eebls_gpu_fast_adaptive(t, y, dy, freqs, qmin=qmins, qmax=qmaxes)
```

### Current GPU Utilization (RTX 4000 Ada, 48 SMs)

| Use Case | ndata | nfreq | Grid Size | GPU Saturation |
|----------|-------|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Sparse ground | 100 | 480k | 5000 blocks | ✓ Saturated |
| Dense ground | 500 | 734k | 5000 blocks | ✓ Saturated |
| Space-based | 20k | 891k | 5000 blocks | ✓ Saturated |

**Finding**: With grid_size=5000 and 48 SMs, we launch 104 blocks per SM, which saturates the GPU. **However**, this doesn't mean we can't benefit from batching!

### Why Batching Could Still Help

1. **Kernel launch overhead**: Even though GPU is saturated during compute, there's ~0.001-0.002s overhead between kernels
   - For 5M lightcurves: 5000-10000s wasted on launches alone!
   - Batching reduces # of launches

2. **Memory transfer overhead**: Currently transferring data sequentially
   - Could overlap compute with memory transfer using streams
   - Pipeline: transfer LC N+1 while computing LC N

3. **Larger GPUs have more SMs**: On A100/H100, single LC may NOT saturate

## Question 2: How do speedups scale to different GPUs?

### GPU Comparison

| GPU | SMs | Max Blocks | Max Threads | Single LC Saturates? |
|-----|-----|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| RTX 4000 Ada | 48 | 1,152 | 73,728 | YES (5000 blocks) |
| A100 (40GB) | 108 | 2,592 | 165,888 | YES (5000 blocks) |
| A100 (80GB) | 108 | 2,592 | 165,888 | YES (5000 blocks) |
| H100 | 132 | 3,168 | 202,752 | YES (5000 blocks) |
| H200 | 132 | 3,168 | 202,752 | YES (5000 blocks) |
| B200 | ~200* | ~4,800* | ~307,200* | YES (5000 blocks) |

*B200 specs estimated based on Blackwell architecture

### Will Speedups Change on Larger GPUs?

**Short answer: Speedups will be SIMILAR, possibly BETTER.**

#### Why speedups should be similar:

1. **Kernel launch overhead is architecture-independent**
   - Measured ~0.17s constant overhead on RTX 4000 Ada
   - Likely similar on A100/H100 (maybe 0.10-0.15s)
   - Adaptive approach eliminates this overhead regardless of GPU

2. **Block sizing benefits are universal**
   - Small ndata → poor thread utilization on ANY GPU
   - Dynamic block sizing fixes this on all architectures

#### Why speedups might be BETTER on larger GPUs:

1. **More memory bandwidth**
   - A100: 1.6 TB/s (vs RTX 4000 Ada: 360 GB/s)
   - H100: 3.35 TB/s
   - Faster data transfers → lower kernel overhead → bigger relative gain

2. **Better occupancy schedulers**
   - Newer GPUs have improved warp schedulers
   - Better at hiding latency with small block sizes
   - Could see 100x+ speedups instead of 90x

3. **More SMs = better concurrent stream utilization**
   - RTX 4000 Ada saturates at 5000 blocks
   - A100/H100 could run 2-3 lightcurves concurrently
   - Additional 2-3x speedup for batch processing

### Expected Performance on Different GPUs

#### RTX 4000 Ada (Current Results)
```
Sparse (ndata=100): 5.3x speedup
Dense (ndata=500):  3.4x speedup
Space (ndata=20k):  1.4x speedup
```

#### A100 (Predicted)
```
Sparse (ndata=100): 6-8x speedup
  - Better memory bandwidth → lower overhead
  - Could batch 2 LCs concurrently → 2x more

Dense (ndata=500):  3.5-4x speedup
  - Similar to RTX 4000 Ada

Space (ndata=20k):  1.5-2x speedup
  - Better memory bandwidth helps large transfers
```

#### H100 (Predicted)
```
Sparse (ndata=100): 8-12x speedup
  - 2x better memory bandwidth than A100
  - Could batch 3 LCs concurrently → 3x more

Dense (ndata=500):  4-5x speedup
  - Better bandwidth + occupancy

Space (ndata=20k):  2-2.5x speedup
  - Massive bandwidth helps data movement
```

#### H200/B200 (Predicted)
```
Similar to H100, possibly 10-20% better due to:
- Improved memory architecture
- Better schedulers
- More SMs for concurrent batching
```

## Batching Opportunities Not Yet Exploited

### 1. CUDA Streams for Concurrent Execution

Even though single LC saturates GPU on RTX 4000 Ada, larger GPUs could benefit:

```python
# Potential implementation
def process_batch_concurrent(lightcurves, freqs, qmins, qmaxes, n_streams=4):
    streams = [cuda.Stream() for _ in range(n_streams)]
    memories = [bls.BLSMemory(...) for _ in range(n_streams)]

    results = []
    for i, (t, y, dy) in enumerate(lightcurves):
        stream_idx = i % n_streams

        # Async memory transfer and compute
        power = bls.eebls_gpu_fast_adaptive(
            t, y, dy, freqs, qmin=qmins, qmax=qmaxes,
            stream=streams[stream_idx],
            memory=memories[stream_idx]
        )
        results.append(power)

    # Synchronize all streams
    for s in streams:
        s.synchronize()

    return results
```

**Expected benefit**:
- RTX 4000 Ada: 1.2-1.5x (overlap launch overhead)
- A100/H100: 2-3x (true concurrent execution)

### 2. Persistent Kernels

Instead of launching kernel for each lightcurve, keep GPU busy continuously:

```cuda
__global__ void persistent_bls(lightcurve_queue) {
    while (has_work()) {
        lightcurve = get_next_lightcurve();
        process_bls(lightcurve);
    }
}
```

**Expected benefit**: 5-10x by eliminating ALL launch overhead

### 3. Frequency Batching for Small ndata

For ndata < 32, we could process multiple frequency ranges in a single kernel:

**Expected benefit**: Additional 2-3x for sparse surveys

## Recommendations
