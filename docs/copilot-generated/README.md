# Copilot-Generated Documentation

This directory contains documentation files that were automatically generated by GitHub Copilot and other AI coding assistants during the modernization and cleanup of the cuvarbase codebase.

## Purpose

These documents were created to:
- Provide architectural overviews during code refactoring
- Document modernization plans and roadmaps
- Track implementation progress and summaries
- Assess technology choices and migration strategies

## Usage

These files are primarily for historical reference and to understand the evolution of the codebase during the modernization effort in 2024-2025. They may contain outdated information as the codebase continues to evolve.

For current documentation, please refer to:
- The main [README](../../README.md) in the repository root
- The [official documentation](https://johnh2o2.github.io/cuvarbase/)
- The [CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide

## Contents

These files include architectural documents, assessment summaries, implementation notes, migration guides, and technology comparisons that were useful during the development process but are not part of the core project documentation.
