# Getting Started with Assessment Recommendations

This guide helps you take action on the technology assessment findings.

## Start Here

### 1. Read the Assessment (5 minutes)
Start with [README_ASSESSMENT_SUMMARY.md](README_ASSESSMENT_SUMMARY.md) for the executive summary.

### 2. Understand the Decision (15 minutes)
Read [TECHNOLOGY_ASSESSMENT.md](TECHNOLOGY_ASSESSMENT.md) for detailed analysis.

### 3. Review the Plan (10 minutes)
Check [MODERNIZATION_ROADMAP.md](MODERNIZATION_ROADMAP.md) for actionable steps.

### 4. Use as Reference (as needed)
Keep [GPU_FRAMEWORK_COMPARISON.md](GPU_FRAMEWORK_COMPARISON.md) for quick comparisons.

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Do you need to decide about PyCUDA?
│
├─ YES: Considering migration?
│  └─> Read TECHNOLOGY_ASSESSMENT.md
│     Answer: Keep PyCUDA
│
├─ YES: Want to improve cuvarbase?
│  └─> Read MODERNIZATION_ROADMAP.md
│     Start with Phase 1 (Python 3.7+)
│
├─ YES: Starting a new GPU project?
│  └─> Read GPU_FRAMEWORK_COMPARISON.md
│     Decision matrix on page 1
│
└─ NO: Just browsing?
   └─> Read README_ASSESSMENT_SUMMARY.md
      TL;DR: Stay with PyCUDA, focus on modernization
```

## Immediate Next Steps (If You Agree)

### Step 1: Close the Issue
The assessment is complete. You can close the original issue with:

```
Assessment complete. Recommendation: Continue with PyCUDA.

See assessment documents:
- TECHNOLOGY_ASSESSMENT.md
- MODERNIZATION_ROADMAP.md  
- GPU_FRAMEWORK_COMPARISON.md
- README_ASSESSMENT_SUMMARY.md

Key finding: PyCUDA remains optimal. Focus on modernization instead of migration.
```

### Step 2: Plan Modernization (Optional)
If you want to implement the modernization roadmap:

1. Create a new issue: "Modernize cuvarbase (Phase 1: Python 3.7+)"
2. Reference MODERNIZATION_ROADMAP.md
3. Start with Phase 1 tasks

### Step 3: Share with Community (Optional)
- Add link to assessment in README.md
- Announce decision on mailing list/forum
- Help other projects with similar decisions

## FAQ

### Q: Should we migrate from PyCUDA?
**A**: No. See TECHNOLOGY_ASSESSMENT.md for detailed rationale.

### Q: What should we do instead?
**A**: Modernize. See MODERNIZATION_ROADMAP.md Phase 1-4.

### Q: How much work is modernization?
**A**: Phase 1-3 (immediate): 2-3 months part-time. See MODERNIZATION_ROADMAP.md.

### Q: What if PyCUDA becomes unmaintained?
**A**: Revisit in 1 year. Contingency plan in TECHNOLOGY_ASSESSMENT.md.

### Q: Can we use this for other projects?
**A**: Yes! The documents are generic enough to guide similar decisions.

### Q: Who should review this?
**A**: Project maintainers and key contributors.

### Q: What if I disagree?
**A**: Feedback welcome! The assessment is data-driven but open to discussion.
