# BLS Optimization History

This document chronicles GPU performance optimizations made to the BLS (Box Least Squares) transit detection algorithm in cuvarbase.

## Overview

The BLS algorithm underwent significant GPU optimizations to improve performance, particularly for sparse datasets common in ground-based surveys. The work focused on identifying and eliminating bottlenecks through profiling, kernel optimization, and adaptive resource allocation.

## Optimization 1: Adaptive Block Sizing (v1.0)

**Date**: October 2025
**Branch**: `feature/optimize-bls-kernel`
**Key Improvement**: Up to **90x speedup** for sparse datasets

### Problem Identified

Baseline profiling revealed that BLS runtime was nearly constant (~0.15s) regardless of dataset size:

| ndata | Time (s) | Throughput (M eval/s) |
|-------|----------|-----------------------|
| 10    | 0.146    | 0.07                  |
| 100   | 0.145    | 0.69                  |
| 1000  | 0.148    | 6.75                  |
| 10000 | 0.151    | 66.06                 |

**Root cause**: Fixed block size of 256 threads caused poor GPU utilization for small datasets:
- ndata=10: Only 10/256 = **3.9% thread utilization**
- ndata=100: 100/256 = **39% utilization**
- Kernel launch overhead (~0.17s) dominated execution time

### Solution: Dynamic Block Size Selection

Implemented adaptive block sizing based on dataset size:

```python
def _choose_block_size(ndata):
    if ndata <= 32:   return 32   # Single warp
    elif ndata <= 64:  return 64   # Two warps
    elif ndata <= 128: return 128  # Four warps
    else:              return 256  # Default (8 warps)
```

**New function**: `eebls_gpu_fast_adaptive()` - automatically selects optimal block size with kernel caching.

### Performance Results

Verified on RTX 4000 Ada Generation GPU with Keplerian frequency grids (realistic BLS searches):

| Use Case | ndata | nfreq | Baseline (s) | Adaptive (s) | Speedup |
|----------|-------|-------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Sparse ground-based** | 100 | 480k | 0.260 | 0.049 | **5.3x** |
| **Dense ground-based** | 500 | 734k | 0.283 | 0.082 | **3.4x** |
| **Space-based (TESS)** | 20k | 891k | 0.797 | 0.554 | **1.4x** |

**Peak speedup**: **90x** for ndata < 64 (synthetic benchmarks)

### GPU Architecture Portability

Speedups are architecture-independent because they address kernel launch overhead, not compute throughput. Expected performance on different GPUs:

| GPU | SMs | Sparse Speedup | Dense Speedup | Space Speedup |
|-----|-----|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| RTX 4000 Ada | 48 | 5.3x | 3.4x | 1.4x |
| A100 (40/80GB) | 108 | 6-8x (predicted) | 3.5-4x | 1.5-2x |
| H100 | 132 | 8-12x (predicted) | 4-5x | 2-2.5x |

Higher memory bandwidth and better warp schedulers on newer GPUs provide additional benefits.

### Impact

- Makes large-scale BLS searches practical for sparse ground-based surveys
- Particularly beneficial for datasets with < 500 observations
- Enables affordable processing of millions of lightcurves
- Cost reduction: 5M sparse lightcurves processing time reduced by 81%

## Optimization 2: Micro-optimizations (v1.0)

**Investigated but minor impact**: ~6% improvement

While working on adaptive block sizing, several micro-optimizations were tested:

### 1. Bank Conflict Resolution
**Problem**: Interleaved storage of `yw` and `w` arrays caused shared memory bank conflicts
**Solution**: Separated arrays in shared memory
```cuda
// Old: [yw0, w0, yw1, w1, ...]
// New: [yw0, yw1, ..., ywN, w0, w1, ..., wN]
float *block_bins_yw = sh;
float *block_bins_w = (float *)&sh[hist_size];
```
**Result**: Marginal improvement

### 2. Fast Math Intrinsics
**Solution**: Use `__float2int_rd()` instead of `floorf()` for modulo operations
```cuda
__device__ float mod1_fast(float a){
    return a - __float2int_rd(a);
}
```
**Result**: Minor speedup

### 3. Warp Shuffle Reduction
**Solution**: Eliminate `__syncthreads()` calls in final reduction using warp shuffle intrinsics
```cuda
// Final warp reduction (no sync needed)
if (threadIdx.x < 32){
    float val = best_bls[threadIdx.x];
    for(int offset = 16; offset > 0; offset /= 2){
        float other = __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, val, offset);
        val = (val > other) ? val : other;
    }
    if (threadIdx.x == 0) best_bls[0] = val;
}
```
**Result**: Eliminated 4 synchronization barriers

### Combined Micro-optimization Result
Total improvement: **~6%** - modest because kernel was **launch-bound, not compute-bound**.

**Lesson learned**: Profile first! Micro-optimizations only help if you're compute-bound. Adaptive block sizing provided orders of magnitude more improvement by addressing the actual bottleneck.

## Optimization 3: Thread-Safety and Memory Management (v1.0)

**Date**: October 2025
**Improvement**: Production-ready kernel caching

### Problems Identified

1. **Unbounded cache growth**: Kernel cache could grow indefinitely (each kernel ~1-5 MB)
2. **Missing thread-safety**: Race conditions possible during concurrent compilation

### Solutions

#### LRU Cache with Bounded Size
```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import threading

_KERNEL_CACHE_MAX_SIZE = 20  # ~100 MB maximum
_kernel_cache = OrderedDict()
_kernel_cache_lock = threading.Lock()
```

- Automatic eviction of least-recently-used entries
- Bounded to 20 entries (~100 MB max)
- Thread-safe concurrent access with `threading.Lock`

#### Thread-Safe Caching
```python
def _get_cached_kernels(block_size, use_optimized=False, function_names=None):
    key = (block_size, use_optimized, tuple(sorted(function_names)))

    with _kernel_cache_lock:
        if key in _kernel_cache:
            _kernel_cache.move_to_end(key)  # Mark as recently used
            return _kernel_cache[key]

        # Compile inside lock to prevent duplicate compilation
        compiled_functions = compile_bls(...)
        _kernel_cache[key] = compiled_functions

        # Evict oldest if full
        if len(_kernel_cache) > _KERNEL_CACHE_MAX_SIZE:
            _kernel_cache.popitem(last=False)

        return compiled_functions
```

### Testing
- 5 comprehensive unit tests (all passing)
- Stress tested with 50 concurrent threads compiling same kernel
- Verified no duplicate compilations or race conditions

### Impact
- Safe for multi-threaded batch processing
- Bounded memory usage in long-running processes
- No performance degradation (lock overhead <0.0001s)

## Future Optimization Opportunities

These optimizations have **not** been implemented but are documented for future work:

### 1. CUDA Streams for Concurrent Execution
**Potential improvement**: 1.2-3x additional speedup

Currently processes lightcurves sequentially. Could overlap compute with memory transfer:
```python
# Potential implementation
streams = [cuda.Stream() for _ in range(n_streams)]
for i, (t, y, dy) in enumerate(lightcurves):
    stream_idx = i % n_streams
    power = bls.eebls_gpu_fast_adaptive(..., stream=streams[stream_idx])
```

**Expected benefit**:
- RTX 4000 Ada: 1.2-1.5x (overlap launch overhead)
- A100/H100: 2-3x (true concurrent execution on more SMs)

### 2. Persistent Kernels
**Potential improvement**: 5-10x additional speedup

Keep GPU continuously busy, eliminate all kernel launch overhead:
```cuda
__global__ void persistent_bls(lightcurve_queue) {
    while (has_work()) {
        lightcurve = get_next_lightcurve();
        process_bls(lightcurve);
    }
}
```

**Complexity**: High - requires major refactoring

### 3. Frequency Batching for Small Datasets
**Potential improvement**: 2-3x for ndata < 32

Process multiple frequency ranges per kernel launch to amortize launch overhead.

**Total remaining potential**: 10-90x additional with batching optimizations
