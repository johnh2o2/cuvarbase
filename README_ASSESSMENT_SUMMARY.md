## Key Findings

### Why PyCUDA Wins

1. **Custom Kernels are Critical**
   - cuvarbase has 6 hand-optimized CUDA kernels
   - Represent years of domain expertise
   - Cannot be easily translated to other frameworks
   - Core competitive advantage

2. **Performance is Already Optimal**
   - Direct CUDA API access
   - Minimal Python overhead
   - Fine-tuned for astronomy algorithms
   - Alternatives unlikely to improve

3. **Migration Cost is Prohibitive**
   - Estimated 3-12 months full-time effort
   - High risk of performance regression
   - Breaking changes for all users
   - Opportunity cost (new features vs migration)

4. **PyCUDA is Stable and Maintained**
   - Active development (2024 releases)
   - Trusted by astronomy community
   - No critical blocking issues
   - Works with modern CUDA versions

### What Alternatives Offer

**CuPy**: Easier installation, better NumPy compatibility
- **But**: Cannot directly use existing CUDA kernels
- **Migration**: 3-6 months, high risk

**Numba**: Python kernel syntax, CPU fallback
- **But**: Performance penalty, need to rewrite kernels
- **Migration**: 4-8 months, high risk

**JAX**: Auto-differentiation, ML integration
- **But**: Not designed for custom kernels, wrong fit
- **Migration**: 6-12 months, very high risk

   - No response to bug reports

2. **Critical blocking issue**
   - Unfixable compatibility problem
   - Major performance regression
   - Security vulnerability

3. **Major rewrite needed**
   - Fundamentally new algorithms
   - Complete redesign
   - Grant funding for rewrite

4. **Community consensus**
   - Strong user demand

Instead of risky migration, focus on:
- ✓ Modernizing Python support
- ✓ Improving documentation and installation
- ✓ Adding CI/CD and testing
- ✓ Optional CPU fallback for broader accessibility

This approach delivers real value to users without the risk of a major migration.
